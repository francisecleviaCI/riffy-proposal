Ideas
    
App Name: Living Comfortably in NYC.

App Summary - The app will take as many user inputs regarding their monthly spend and compare it to the average New York city citizen spend. Using the 'left over' money from their monthly take home pay and assuming they invested it, the app will estimate their savings at their desired retirement date and calculate whether they have enough to retire with.

App Logic - 

Basics: Will act as a budgeting app, taking inputs such as monthly income, food & housing expense, and calculate if the user overspent for the month and compare to the average NYC citizen. There will be pre-loaded values of the average New York City citizen's monthly spend in various categories. 

Based off the estimated retirement amount, the app will recommend other places in the country if their retirement net worth is not enough to sustain a comfortable lifestyle in NYC.

App will also be able to recommend how much more the user should save to attain the desired retirement amount.


Stretch Goals - 
    1. Take the historical spend on housing and automatically show a map in NYC or the recommended place of retirement.
    2. Based off user inputs of what they like to spend money on and/or interest, the app will recommend what neighborhood/borough to live in.
